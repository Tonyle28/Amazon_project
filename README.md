# 📊 Amazon Discount Strategy Report

## 📝 Overview

This project analyzes Amazon’s discount strategies across various product categories, focusing on how discounts impact **sales volume**, **customer ratings**, and **purchase behavior**. Despite assumptions, deeper discounts don’t always lead to higher satisfaction or more sales — and sometimes, they’re not effective at all.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🎯 Discounts & Customer Ratings

- Weak correlation between discount % and customer ratings (r = -0.16).
- Regression plots:
  - Discount vs. Rating: R² = 0.0242
  - Discount vs. Rating Count: R² = 0.0001
- Customers care more about **product quality** than discounts.

> 📌 Office Products scored the **highest rating (4.31)** despite the **lowest discount (12.35%)**.

### 💸 Discount vs Sales Volume (Figure 5)

- **Electronics & Computers**: High discounts (50%+) = high sales → effective use of discounting.
- **Home & Kitchen**: Moderate discounts = moderate sales → influenced by utility, design, or presentation.
- **Office Products & Others**: High/low discounts, still low sales → discounts don’t drive demand here.

### ⭐ Average Discount vs Customer Rating (Figure 7)

- **Office Products**: Highest average rating (4.31) with minimal discount → quality wins over price.
- **Electronics & Computers**: Heavy discounts (>50%) but only moderate ratings (~4.1) → discounts ≠ satisfaction.
- **Low-rated items** often receive deep discounts → signals quality or expectation issues not solved by price drops.

---

## 🔎 High-Ticket Item Trends

- **Electronics**: Lowest discount (36%) but highest sales → strong natural demand.
- **Computers & Accessories**: Deep discounts (47.7%) yet lowest sales → brand loyalty or saturation may be factors.
- **Home & Kitchen**: High discounts but weak sales → discounts ineffective for high-end home goods.

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Improve **product quality** and **description accuracy** to match customer expectations.
- Use **targeted, seasonal discounts** in high-performing categories like Electronics.
- Rethink strategy for weak categories: try **bundling**, **loyalty perks**, or **better segmentation** instead of markdowns.
